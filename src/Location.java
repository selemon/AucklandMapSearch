/** Location
    A Location is a point in a 2D coordinate system,
    with increasing x from west to east and increasing y
    from south to north (ordinary mathematical coordinates).
    Locations are represented with two doubles, (with an unspecified
    length unit - could be kilometers, for example).

    Location provides methods for converting between Locations
    and Points representing pixel positions on a window/screen.
    A Point is represented by two integers representing screen/window
    positions (x to the right and y down).

    The conversion needs
    - an origin Location [a Location at the origin will be converted to
      the point (0,0)]
    - a scale specifying how many pixels per length unit.
      Typically the scale will be  ( windowSize /(maxLocation - minLocation))
